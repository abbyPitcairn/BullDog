# üê∂ Bulldog Game: AI vs. Human Development  

**Author:** Abby Pitcairn

## üìå Overview  

This project explores the differences between human-created and AI-assisted software development. Changes to the game implement popular design patterns such as Singelton and Strategy. Development notes archive details the process of producing each iteration of this project, including insights into how AI helped or hindered human code production. 

- **Program 1**: Developed entirely by a human, without AI assistance.  
- **Program 2**: Generated by an AI with minimal human intervention.
- **Program 4**: Generated by AI and human to add a Java Swing GUI to the game.
- **Program 5**: Working directly off of program 4, AI generated specific improvements to the code.
- **Program 6**: Continuing from program 5, added better design principles with the help of AI.
- **Program 7**: Continuing from program 6, added more Singleton designs and a new Player type with test cases.
- **Program 8**: Continuing from program 7, added a GameStatus class to track game status and refactored abstract Player class's play() method.
- **Program 9**: Suggested some additional changes to the Bulldog game, and changed FifteenPlayer to VariablePlayer, where the original turn score limit of 15 is now chosen by user input.
