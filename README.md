## 📌 Overview  

This project explores the differences between human-created and AI-assisted software development.  

- **Program 1**: Developed entirely by a human, without AI assistance.  
- **Program 2**: Generated by an AI with minimal human intervention.
- **Program 4**: Generated by AI and human to add a Java Swing GUI to the game.
- **Program 5**: Working directly off of program 4, AI generated specific improvements to the code. 

Future updates will include a deeper analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of AI-assisted coding, evaluating its impact on software quality, efficiency, and maintainability.  

Stay tuned for insights into the evolving role of AI in programming.
